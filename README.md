# RSLife
Game of Life implementation in Rust

This particular piece of code serves as a way for me to lean Rust and is my
first project in this language.

## Compiling
Simply typing `make` should result in a `rslife` binary that you can then run.

## Usage
You will be promted to choose an interval and a file to read a grid from. By
not supplying a filename a random grid will be generated for you at a size you
choose.
